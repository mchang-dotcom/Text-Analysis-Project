# Text-Analysis-Project

This is my Text Analysis project exploring natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from textual data. This notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, tokenization, feature extraction, and model-based text classification. The workflow highlights how linguistic patterns can be analyzed to understand sentiment, identify trends, and visualize word-level relationships using Python libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
